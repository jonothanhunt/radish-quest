# radish quest

I love radishes, so I've combined radish data from my own higher-than-average radish consumption with an opportunity to experiment and learn with different libraries. 

Specifically, so far I've experimented with making a React Three Fiber segment for the 3D radish, a Recharts chart, and using Tailwind for styling.

## To do:

- [ ] Better document and link the project here
- [ ] Add authentication and the ability to add and edit data via the site itself
- [ ] Add further radish-related data
- [ ] Potentially connect to weather APIs to find correlations :tada:
